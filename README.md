## ðŸ“‚ Dataset: `nfl-data.csv`

For this project, I built a custom dataset (`nfl-data.csv`) covering every NFL team from 2018â€“2024.  

The following metrics were collected from [Sports Odds History](https://www.sportsoddshistory.com/nfl-regular-season-win-total-results-by-team/):
- **Vegas_OU** â€“ Preseason over/under lines 
- **Actual_Wins** â€“ Final regular season win total

The following metric was collected from [PhillyVoice](https://www.phillyvoice.com/ranking-nfl-teams-age-after-53-man-cutdowns-2024-edition/), which publishes a yearly article, released before the season, that ranks NFL rosters by average age after 53-man cutdowns:
- **Avg_Age** â€“ Preseason roster average age

The following metrics were collected from [Football Outsiders / FTN Fantasy](https://ftnfantasy.com/nfl/2024-dvoa-projections), which publishes a yearly article with preseason DVOA projections (archived via the Wayback Machine for older seasons): 
- **Total_DVOA** â€“ Overall projected team efficiency  
- **Off_DVOA** â€“ Offensive efficiency projection  
- **Def_DVOA** â€“ Defensive efficiency projection  
- **ST_DVOA** â€“ Special teams efficiency projection  
- **Sched%** â€“ Schedule difficulty rating  
- **Mean_Wins** â€“ Average projected win total  
- **No1_Pick_Odds** â€“ Probability of earning the #1 draft pick  
- **Playoff_Odds** â€“ Probability of making the playoffs  
- **SB_Win_Odds** â€“ Probability of winning the Super Bowl  

The following metrics were collected from [Pro-Football-Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2023/index.htm). These values were gathered at the end of the season from 2017â€“2023 (after the Super Bowl) and then attributed to the following yearâ€™s team (e.g., 2017 end-of-season  ratings were used as the 2018 teamâ€™s baseline). These represent previous-season performance metrics, not preseason projections.    
- **SOS** â€“ End-of-season strength of schedule rating  
- **SRS** â€“ Overall end-of-season rating combining point differential and schedule strength  
- **OSRS** â€“ Offensive component of SRS  
- **DSRS** â€“ Defensive component of SRS  

The following metrics were collected from [ESPN FPI](https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi), I captured the preseason FPI ratings for every team as they appeared immediately before the season began (archived via the Wayback Machine for older seasons):  
- **FPI_Total** â€“ Overall team rating (expected point margin per game vs. an average opponent on a neutral field)  
- **FPI_Off** â€“ Offensive component of FPI  
- **FPI_Def** â€“ Defensive component of FPI 

The following metrics were collected from [TeamRankings](https://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/), I gathered end-of-season values (after the Super Bowl) and attributed them to the following seasonâ€™s team. These represent previous-season performance metrics, not preseason projections.    
- **Luck_Rating** â€“ Measures how much a teamâ€™s record was influenced by randomness (e.g., close games, turnovers)  
- **Full_Season_Rating** â€“ Predictive power rating for the team based on the entire seasonâ€™s performance  
- **Momentum_Rating** â€“ Predictive power rating based on the teamâ€™s **last 10 games** of the season  

ðŸ“Œ These metrics provide additional context on team variance, overall strength, and late-season trends that may carry over into the following year.
